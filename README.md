Your local library simulation app, here for all your book recommendation needs!

## 😏 What you can expect...

- Book recommendations based solely on *your* input, no prompts barred. Fukuyama fan? No problem. Visiting Vienna next month and need a heads-up on tourist traps? We've got you. A aeroplane afficionado with a penchant for Pepper Jack cheese? You've come to the right place.
- A personal reading list, curated by your own good self by liking books our resident librarian Oskar brings back.
- Smart recommendations generated based on the content of your reading list.
- "Friends" feature, allowing you to add other users as friends (and snoop(y) on their reading lists too!)
- A personal inbox, informing you of new friend requests received and keeping you updated on the status of friend requests you have sent.
